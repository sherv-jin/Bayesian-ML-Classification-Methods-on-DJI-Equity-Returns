# Bayesian Machine Learning for Classification: Predicting Dow Jones Index (DJI) Equity Returns

This project explores several Bayesian and probabilistic classification methods to predict stock returns from the **Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)** index. The goal is to build interpretable models that incorporate uncertainty in their predictions using Bayesian inference techniques and gauge it's accuracy against one another

### Classification Methods Used:

| Method                                                  | Type                     | Inference Technique                            | Description                                                                 |
